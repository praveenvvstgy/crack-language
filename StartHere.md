# The Crack Programming Language #

Crack aims to provide the ease of development of a scripting language with the performance of a compiled language.  The "crack" program is a "script executor" that compiles source
to machine code on the fly (it will cache the code to intermediate formats as appropriate).

The language and the executor are still very much in their infancy.  There's no formal documentation yet, but the design notes are here: http://code.google.com/p/crack-language/source/browse/notes.txt
